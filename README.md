What Will I Be Building?
You will be creating the core functionality used for a storefront application. The visual of the storefront and the JavaScript necessary to connect the code you will write to that visual has already been created.

Shopping carts are a fantastic tool for practicing JavaScript fundamentals.

Breaking it Down
If you picture an online store, there are typically three parts, the product listing, the cart, and the checkout. You will be responsible for getting all 3 of these pieces working.

Products
First, think of the product list. You have learned about object literals. Objects are a perfect way to store product data, and you can use an array to collect those objects. Each product must be able to be added to the cart.

Cart
Next, we have the shopping cart. Carts usually have quite a bit of functionality. Once the cart is populated with products, you need to be able to increase or decrease the quantity or fully remove an item. The cart often displays the individual product totals and updates as the quantity changes.

Checkout
Finally, there’s the checkout. For this project, assume it’s a cash-only storefront at a street market. The checkout should show the final amount due for all products in the cart. For any amount of cash received, the receipt should show what is still owed by the customer or how much should be returned to the customer if they gave more than the total due.

When we build professional shopping carts, we almost always want to have that data stored somewhere so that we can access it later for things like accounting, inventory, and returns. You won’t have to worry about a backend at this point, but the work you do with your product objects will set you up well for future projects where you do have a backend you need to access.
